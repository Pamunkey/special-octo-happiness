# Contributing to rust-curve25519-fiat
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Our Development Process

Every pull request should have a description that motivates it and should have tests that cover all of the source lines touched and added by the request. No pull request will be merged unless all tests are passing.

A TODO comment should include the number of an issue that describes the outstanding work in greater detail.

All APIs should be documented in the code and all public methods and functions should have explicit assertion statements to document and enforce any preconditions that they depend on.

A pull request that is a work in progress that has been published to get help and feedback from the community should be tagged with WIP.

The person approving a pull request will also merge it into master.
